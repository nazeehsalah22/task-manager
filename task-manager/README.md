# 📋 Task Manager Dashboard

A modern, feature-rich **Task Management Dashboard** built with **Angular 21**, leveraging cutting-edge framework capabilities including Standalone Components, Signals, and the experimental `HttpResource` API.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The Task Manager Dashboard is a single-page application that enables teams to manage tasks across a Kanban-style board, track performance via analytics charts, and perform real-time filtering of tasks by status, priority, and assignee.

### Key Features

- 📌 **Kanban Board** — Drag or move tasks across `Todo`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, and `Done` columns
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** — Visual breakdown of task distributions using Chart.js
- 🔍 **Live Search & Filtering** — Filter tasks by status, priority, and assignee with debounced search
- ✏️ **Full CRUD** — Create, edit, and delete tasks via Material dialogs
- 📈 **Statistics Cards** — At-a-glance summaries of task counts and completion rates
- 🔄 **Recent Activity Feed** — Live feed of the latest task updates
- 🌐 **GitHub Pages Deployment** — Automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Component Architecture

The app uses **100% Standalone Components** (no NgModules), aligned with modern Angular 17+ best practices. All components are self-contained with their own imports, enabling better tree-shaking and faster compilation.

```
src/app/
├── core/                   # Singleton services, models, interceptors
│   ├── interceptors/       # HTTP interceptors (error handling, mock backend)
│   ├── models/             # TypeScript interfaces (Task, Statistic)
│   └── services/           # TaskService, SearchService
├── dashboard/              # Feature area: main dashboard view
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── stat-card/      # Summary statistic cards
│   │   ├── task-board/     # Kanban board container
│   │   ├── task-card/      # Individual task card
│   │   ├── task-analytics/ # Charts page
│   │   ├── recent-activity/# Activity feed
│   │   └── toolbar/        # Search & filter toolbar
│   └── dashboard.ts        # Root dashboard component
├── layout/                 # Shell layout (sidebar & router outlet)
├── shared/                 # Reusable UI components
│   ├── dialogs/            # TaskFormDialog, ConfirmDialog
│   ├── spinner/            # Loading indicator
│   └── no-data/            # Empty state UI
└── app.routes.ts           # Lazy-loaded route configuration
```

### Lazy Loading

All feature routes are **lazy-loaded** using `loadComponent()`, keeping the initial bundle small:

```ts
{
  path: 'dashboard',
  loadComponent: () => import('./dashboard/dashboard').then(m => m.Dashboard)
},
{
  path: 'analytics',
  loadComponent: () => import('./dashboard/components/task-analytics/task-analytics').then(m => m.TaskAnalytics)
}
```

### Change Detection

All components use **`ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`** to minimize re-renders. Combined with Signals, the framework only re-renders when reactive state actually changes.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Node.js | 20.x or later |
| npm | 10.x or later |
| Angular CLI | 21.x |

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nazeehsalah22/task-manager.git
cd task-manager/task-manager

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the app (mock backend mode — no external server needed)
npm start
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

---

## 🌍 Environment Configuration

Environment files are located in `src/environments/`:

| File | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `environment.ts` | Production (default build) |
| `environment.development.ts` | Local development |
| `environment.prod.ts` | Explicit production override |

### Configuration options

```ts
export const environment = {
  production: boolean,   // Enables/disables prod optimizations
  apiUrl: string,        // Base URL for the REST API (e.g. http://localhost:3000)
  useMockBackend: boolean // true = use in-memory mock; false = use real json-server
};
```

> **Note:** Set `useMockBackend: true` to run the app fully offline with no external backend dependency. Data is persisted in `localStorage`.

---

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Run development server at `http://localhost:4200` |
| `npm run mock-api` | Start json-server REST API at `http://localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/task-manager/browser/` |
| `npm run watch` | Dev build with file-watching (development config) |
| `npm test` | Run unit tests via Vitest |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests and generate a coverage report |

## 🧠 Design Patterns & State Management

### Signals — Reactive State

Local UI state is managed using Angular **Signals**, eliminating the need for an external state library:

```ts
selectedStatus   = signal<string>('all');
selectedPriority = signal<string>('all');
selectedAssignees = signal<string[]>([]);
```

Signals integrate natively with the Angular change detection system, triggering UI updates only when values actually change.

### `HttpResource` API — Server State

Remote data fetching uses Angular 19+'s experimental **`httpResource`** API, which automatically returns a reactive resource (with `value()`, `isLoading()`, and `error()` signals):

```ts
tasksResource      = httpResource<Task[]>(() => `${this.apiUrl}/tasks`);
statisticsResource = httpResource<Statistic[]>(() => `${this.apiUrl}/statistics`);
```

After any mutation (create/update/delete), the resource is revalidated by calling `.reload()`.

### Mock Backend Interceptor — Offline-First Development

`mockBackendInterceptor` is a functional HTTP interceptor that intercepts all API calls and serves responses from **`localStorage`** (seeded from `db.json`). This enables:
- Full CRUD functionality without a running backend server
- Simulated network latency (500ms delay) for realistic UX testing
- Persistent data between page reloads via `localStorage`

### Dependency Injection

All services use `inject()` (function-based DI) instead of constructor injection, which is the modern Angular pattern in standalone components:

```ts
private taskService = inject(TaskService);
private dialog      = inject(MatDialog);
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The project uses **Vitest** (via `@angular/build:unit-test`) as the test runner — a significantly faster alternative to Karma/Jasmine.

### Test Structure

- **Service tests** (`task.spec.ts`, `search.spec.ts`) — Unit tests for business logic and HTTP interactions using mocked `HttpClient`
- **Interceptor tests** (`error.interceptor.spec.ts`) — Verifies error-handling behavior for HTTP 4xx/5xx responses
- **Component tests** (`dashboard.spec.ts`, `app.spec.ts`) — Smoke tests verifying component creation and basic rendering

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (single run)
npm test -- --watch=false

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory and are also produced during CI.

## ⚡ Performance Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Location | Benefit |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **OnPush Change Detection** | All components | Reduces re-render cycles drastically |
| **Lazy-loaded routes** | `app.routes.ts` | Smaller initial bundle; features load on demand |
| **Signals instead of RxJS BehaviorSubjects** | Services & components | Fine-grained reactivity with less overhead |
| **`httpResource` auto-caching** | `TaskService` | Avoids redundant HTTP calls |
| **Standalone components** | All components | Better tree-shaking; eliminates unused NgModule glue code |
| **`trackBy` equivalents via Signals** | Template binding | Efficient list diffing |
| **Mock Backend in LocalStorage** | `mock-backend.interceptor.ts` | Zero-dependency data layer for demos/offline |

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Known Limitations

- **`HttpResource` is experimental** — The API may change in future Angular releases. It is not recommended for production use without monitoring Angular's changelog.
- **Mock backend is not synchronized** — Statistics are static (seeded from `db.json`) and do not update reactively when tasks change. A real backend would compute these dynamically.
- **No authentication** — The app has no login, session management, or role-based access control.
- **No drag-and-drop** — Tasks are moved between columns via a menu/button, not via native drag-and-drop.
- **No real-time updates** — Multiple browser tabs do not stay in sync (no WebSocket or Server-Sent Events).

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Replace mock backend with a real REST API (e.g., NestJS or Firebase)
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop support using `@angular/cdk/drag-drop`
- [ ] Implement authentication with JWT and route guards
- [ ] Add WebSocket support for live multi-user collaboration
- [ ] Make statistics reactive (recalculate on task changes)
- [ ] Add pagination or virtual scrolling for large task lists
- [ ] Implement dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Expand test coverage to include integration tests with Angular Testing Library
- [ ] Add PWA support for offline usage and installability

## 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment

The app is deployed automatically to **GitHub Pages** via a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push to `master`.

### Pipeline Steps

1. Checkout the repository
2. Set up Node.js 20 with npm cache
3. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
4. Run tests with coverage (`npm run test:coverage`)
5. Build the Angular app with correct `--base-href` (`/task-manager/`)
6. Copy `index.html` → `404.html` to fix SPA routing on GitHub Pages
7. Upload and deploy the build artifact to GitHub Pages
